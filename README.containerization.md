# Containerization Strategy for Autonomous Trading System

This document outlines the containerization strategy for our autonomous trading system, explaining the architecture, deployment considerations, and best practices.

## Architecture Overview

The system is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose. Each component of the system runs in its own container, allowing for:

- Independent scaling
- Isolated dependencies
- Simplified deployment
- Consistent development and production environments

### Container Services

1. **System Controller**: Orchestrates the overall system and provides API endpoints for monitoring and control
2. **Data Acquisition**: Collects market data from various sources (Polygon, Unusual Whales)
3. **Trading Strategy**: Implements trading algorithms and executes trades via Alpaca
4. **Model Training**: Trains and manages ML models using GPU acceleration
5. **Feature Engineering**: Processes raw data into features for ML models
6. **Continuous Learning**: Monitors model performance and triggers retraining

## Container Base Images

All ML-related containers use NVIDIA's TensorFlow image as a base:
- `nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:24.02-tf2-py3`

This provides:
- Pre-optimized TensorFlow with GPU support
- CUDA and cuDNN libraries
- Python 3.10 environment

## Resource Allocation

Each container has specific resource limits defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

| Service | CPU Limit | Memory Limit | GPU Access |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| System Controller | 1.0 | 1G | No |
| Data Acquisition | 1.0 | 1G | No |
| Trading Strategy | 1.0 | 1G | No |
| Model Training | 2.0 | 4G | Yes |
| Feature Engineering | 1.0 | 2G | No |
| Continuous Learning | 1.0 | 2G | No |

## Data Persistence

The system uses Docker volumes for data persistence:

- **logs**: Shared volume for all container logs
- **data**: Market data, features, and other persistent data
- **models**: Trained models and checkpoints

## Environment Configuration

Environment variables control the behavior of each container:

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample`
2. Set appropriate values for your environment (development, staging, production)
3. Environment-specific settings are handled in each container's start script

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24.0+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for GPU support)
- At least 16GB RAM
- NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (for production)

### Development Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/autonomous-trading-system.git
cd autonomous-trading-system

# Create .env file
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Build and start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Production Deployment

For production, consider:

1. Using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for orchestration
2. Implementing proper secrets management
3. Setting up monitoring and alerting
4. Configuring automatic backups
5. Using a container registry

## Security Considerations

1. All containers run as non-root users
2. Sensitive information is passed via environment variables
3. API keys should be stored securely (consider using Docker secrets in production)
4. Network access is limited to necessary ports only

## Monitoring and Logging

- All containers output logs to the shared logs volume
- Logs follow a consistent format for easy parsing
- Consider integrating with ELK stack or similar for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GPU not detected**: Ensure NVIDIA Container Toolkit is properly installed
2. **Database connection failures**: Check TimescaleDB container is running and credentials are correct
3. **API rate limiting**: Adjust data collection frequency in environment variables

### Debugging

```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs -f model-training

# Access a container shell
docker-compose exec feature-engineering bash
```

## Future Improvements

1. Implement health checks for all containers
2. Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
3. Optimize container sizes
4. Implement blue-green deployment strategy
5. Add distributed training support for larger models
