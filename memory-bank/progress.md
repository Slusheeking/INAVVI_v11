# Project Progress

## System Management and Deployment

[2025-03-21 06:04:30] - Implemented comprehensive system management scripts:
- Created `scripts/start_system.py` with health checks and Slack notifications
- Created `scripts/stop_system.py` for graceful system shutdown
- Added shell script wrappers `start.sh` and `stop.sh` for easy system management
- Updated Docker configuration to use the new unified system management approach
- Added detailed README.md with usage instructions

## Bug Fixes

[2025-03-21 06:04:30] - Fixed import issues in scripts:
- Updated import paths in all script files to use the correct module paths
- Added `get_gpu_memory_usage` function to gpu_utils.py
- Fixed permission issues by using relative paths for data directories

## System Monitoring

[2025-03-22 01:36:52] - Standardized Redis configuration across all system components:
- Updated docker-compose.unified.yml to use correct Redis port mapping (6380:6380)
- Updated unified_system.py to include username parameter and correct default password
- Updated trading_engine.py with correct Redis port, username, and password
- Updated ml_engine.py to include username and password parameters
- Updated scripts/start_system.py with correct default password
- Ensured all Redis configurations use consistent settings (port 6380, username 'default', password 'trading_system_2025')
- Updated decisionLog.md with the rationale and implications of these changes

## System Monitoring

[2025-03-21 06:04:30] - Enhanced system monitoring:
- Added comprehensive health checks for all system components
- Implemented Slack notifications for system status
- Added periodic health checks with configurable intervals
- Created monitoring for system resources (CPU, memory, GPU)

## Docker Deployment

[2025-03-21 06:04:30] - Improved Docker deployment:
- Updated Dockerfile.unified to use the new start/stop scripts
- Added graceful shutdown handling in docker-compose.unified.yml
- Created a shutdown script for the Docker container
- Added proper environment variable handling

## Next Steps

[2025-03-21 06:04:30] - Planned improvements:
- Implement a web-based dashboard for system monitoring
- Add automatic recovery mechanisms for component failures
- Enhance health checks with API connectivity tests

[2025-03-21 06:34:50] - Implemented automatic memory bank activation:
- Created `scripts/activate_memory_bank.py` for automatic memory bank loading
- Added shell script wrapper `activate_memory_bank.sh` for easy execution
- Updated `.roomodes` to include memory bank functionality for the Code mode
- Fixed syntax error in Python script using splitlines() instead of split('\n')
- Updated memory bank files to document the changes

[2025-03-21 17:14:50] - Fixed API client import issues in trading_engine.py:
- Updated imports to use the correct client classes from api_clients.py
- Fixed Redis authentication by adding username parameter
- Resolved "Authentication required" errors in Redis connections
- Ensured proper client initialization for Polygon and Unusual Whales APIs

[2025-03-21 17:18:30] - Fixed logging directory issue in start_system.py:
- Added code to ensure logs directory exists before configuring logging
- Fixed FileNotFoundError when starting the system
- Improved path handling for logs directory

[2025-03-21 17:28:00] - Standardized Redis port configuration across all files:
- Updated api_clients.py to use port 6380 and proper authentication
- Updated docker-compose.unified.yml to use consistent port 6380
- Updated Dockerfile.unified to expose port 6380 instead of 6379
- Updated config.py to use port 6380 as default Redis port
- Ensured consistent Redis authentication parameters across all files

[2025-03-22 01:22:00] - Fixed Redis configuration for local development:
- Modified redis.conf to use local data directory instead of /data
- Fixed Redis startup issues for local development
- Verified Redis connection with proper authentication
- Confirmed API clients are correctly configured to work with Redis
- Created verify_gpu_stack.py script to test TensorFlow, TensorRT, CuPy, and Redis

[2025-03-22 02:45:00] - Enhanced TensorFlow, TensorRT, and CuPy integration:
- Updated Dockerfile.unified with optimized dependencies for all three frameworks
- Enhanced environment variables in config.env for better GPU acceleration
- Updated config.py with comprehensive GPU configuration settings
- Added GPU configuration section to SYSTEM_CONFIG in config.py
- Enhanced ML_CONFIG with TensorRT and CuPy-specific optimizations
- Improved GPU memory management in unified_system.py
- Added detailed GPU component verification in config.py
- Enhanced TensorFlow, TensorRT, and CuPy cleanup during system shutdown
- Added support for mixed precision training and inference
- Updated memory bank files to document all changes

## Next Steps
