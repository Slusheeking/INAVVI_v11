[2025-03-22 21:39:40] - Production Readiness Focus

Current focus is on ensuring the system is production-ready with proper deployment, monitoring, and maintenance capabilities. Key components developed and improvements made:

1. **Docker Build Stability**: Fixed XGBoost dependency issue in Dockerfile.unified by leveraging the pre-installed XGBoost version (1.7.6) from the NVIDIA container instead of attempting to install XGBoost 2.0.2 which had dependency conflicts with numpy.

2. **Integration Testing**: Created comprehensive integration tests that verify all components work together with real API endpoints.

- [2025-03-23 17:00:51] Docker container has been rebuilt with Redis permission fixes. Redis directories now have proper permissions (chmod 777) and conflicting TensorFlow packages have been removed from the Dockerfile.

Current focus is on ensuring the system is production-ready with proper deployment, monitoring, and maintenance capabilities. Key components developed:

1. **Integration Testing**: Created comprehensive integration tests that verify all components work together with real API endpoints.

2. **Production Scripts**: Developed a suite of scripts for production management:
   - `setup_production.sh`: Environment setup
   - `verify_production_readiness.sh`: File verification
   - `run_tests_in_docker.sh`: Docker-based testing
   - `monitor_production.sh`: System monitoring
   - `backup_production_data.sh`: Data backup
   - `manage_production.sh`: Unified management interface

3. **Documentation**: Created detailed `PRODUCTION_README.md` with instructions for setup, management, and troubleshooting.

4. **Docker Configuration**: Optimized Docker setup for NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips with proper volume mappings and service orchestration.

Next steps:
1. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
2. Set up external monitoring for Prometheus endpoints
3. Implement a rolling update strategy for zero-downtime updates
