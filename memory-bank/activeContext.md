# Active Context

## Current Focus

[2025-03-21 06:04:00] - Created comprehensive system management scripts for the trading system:
- Implemented `scripts/start_system.py` with health checks and Slack notifications
- Implemented `scripts/stop_system.py` for graceful system shutdown
- Created shell script wrappers `start.sh` and `stop.sh` for easy system management
- Updated Docker configuration to use the new unified system management approach
- Removed individual component scripts in favor of a unified system approach

## Recent Changes

[2025-03-21 06:04:00] - Added health check functionality that:
- Monitors all system components
- Checks system resources (CPU, memory, GPU)
- Sends status updates to Slack
- Performs periodic health checks with configurable intervals
[2025-03-21 06:04:00] - Enhanced Docker deployment:
- Updated Dockerfile.unified with optimized CUDA settings
- Configured Redis and Prometheus services in docker-compose.unified.yml
- Added volume mounts for persistent data storage
- Implemented health checks for container services

## Recent Changes

[2025-03-22 01:37:15] - Standardized Redis configuration across the system:
- Fixed port mapping in docker-compose.unified.yml (6380:6380)
- Updated Redis client initialization in all components with consistent settings
- Added proper authentication with username and password parameters
- Ensured all components use the same Redis connection parameters

## Open Questions/Issues

[2025-03-22 01:37:15] - Redis connection reliability:
- Need to monitor Redis connection stability in production environment
- Consider implementing connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios
- Evaluate if additional Redis security measures are needed

## Recent Changes

[2025-03-22 02:45:00] - Enhanced TensorFlow, TensorRT, and CuPy integration:
- Updated Dockerfile.unified with optimized dependencies for TensorFlow, TensorRT, and CuPy
- Enhanced environment variables in config.env for better GPU acceleration
- Updated config.py with comprehensive GPU configuration settings
- Improved GPU memory management in unified_system.py
- Added detailed GPU component verification in config.py
- Enhanced TensorFlow, TensorRT, and CuPy cleanup during system shutdown
- Added support for mixed precision training and inference


[2025-03-21 06:04:00] - Enhanced Docker deployment:
- Updated Dockerfile.unified to use the new start/stop scripts
- Added graceful shutdown handling in docker-compose.unified.yml
- Created a shutdown script for the Docker container

[2025-03-21 06:04:00] - Added comprehensive README.md with:
- System overview
- Installation instructions
- Usage instructions for start/stop scripts
- Docker deployment instructions
- Troubleshooting guidance

## Open Questions/Issues

[2025-03-21 06:04:00] - Consider implementing a web-based dashboard for system monitoring
[2025-03-21 06:04:00] - Evaluate adding automatic recovery mechanisms for component failures
[2025-03-21 06:34:00] - Implemented automatic memory bank activation:
- Created scripts/activate_memory_bank.py to automatically load memory bank files
- Added activate_memory_bank.sh shell script wrapper for easy execution
- Updated .roomodes to include memory bank functionality for the Code mode
- Ensured memory bank is always active across all modes

[2025-03-21 17:15:15] - Fixed API client import issues in trading_engine.py:
- Updated imports to use the correct client classes from api_clients.py
- Fixed Redis authentication by adding username parameter
- Resolved "Authentication required" errors in Redis connections
- Ensured proper client initialization for Polygon and Unusual Whales APIs

[2025-03-21 17:30:00] - Standardized Redis port configuration across all system components:
- Updated api_clients.py to use port 6380 and proper authentication
- Updated docker-compose.unified.yml to use consistent port 6380
- Updated Dockerfile.unified to expose port 6380 instead of 6379
- Updated config.py to use port 6380 as default Redis port
- Ensured consistent Redis authentication parameters across all files

[2025-03-22 01:22:30] - Fixed Redis configuration for local development:
- Modified redis.conf to use a local data directory (./data) instead of an absolute path (/data)
- Created verify_gpu_stack.py script to test TensorFlow, TensorRT, CuPy, and Redis
- Verified that Redis is now working correctly with proper authentication
- Confirmed that CuPy is working correctly with the NVIDIA GH200 480GB GPU
- Identified issues with TensorFlow GPU and TensorRT that need further investigation

[2025-03-21 06:04:00] - Consider implementing a more sophisticated health check that includes API connectivity tests
