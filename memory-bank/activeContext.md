[2025-03-22 21:39:40] - Production Readiness Focus

Current focus is on ensuring the system is production-ready with proper deployment, monitoring, and maintenance capabilities. Key components developed and improvements made:

1. **Docker Build Stability**: Fixed XGBoost dependency issue in Dockerfile.unified by leveraging the pre-installed XGBoost version (1.7.6) from the NVIDIA container instead of attempting to install XGBoost 2.0.2 which had dependency conflicts with numpy.

2. **Integration Testing**: Created comprehensive integration tests that verify all components work together with real API endpoints.

Current focus is on ensuring the system is production-ready with proper deployment, monitoring, and maintenance capabilities. Key components developed:

1. **Integration Testing**: Created comprehensive integration tests that verify all components work together with real API endpoints.

2. **Production Scripts**: Developed a suite of scripts for production management:
   - `setup_production.sh`: Environment setup
   - `verify_production_readiness.sh`: File verification
   - `run_tests_in_docker.sh`: Docker-based testing
   - `monitor_production.sh`: System monitoring
   - `backup_production_data.sh`: Data backup
   - `manage_production.sh`: Unified management interface

3. **Documentation**: Created detailed `PRODUCTION_README.md` with instructions for setup, management, and troubleshooting.

4. **Docker Configuration**: Optimized Docker setup for NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips with proper volume mappings and service orchestration.

Next steps:
1. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
2. Set up external monitoring for Prometheus endpoints
3. Implement a rolling update strategy for zero-downtime updates
