# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Unified System Management Pattern**
- Centralized system management with start and stop scripts
- Health checks integrated with monitoring and notifications
- Graceful shutdown handling for all components
- Environment variable management for configuration

## Design Patterns

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Observer Pattern for System Monitoring**
- Monitoring system observes all components
- Components report status and metrics
- Slack notifications act as observers for system events
- Health checks periodically observe system state

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Factory Pattern for Component Initialization**
- Components are created by factory methods in start_system.py
- Dynamic initialization based on configuration
- Consistent error handling across component creation
- Dependency injection for shared resources (Redis, etc.)

## Implementation Patterns

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Resource Management Pattern**
- Proper initialization and cleanup of resources
- Graceful handling of startup and shutdown sequences
- Error handling with appropriate cleanup
- Resource usage monitoring and reporting

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Configuration Management Pattern**
- Environment variables as primary configuration source
- .env file for local development
- Sensible defaults for all configuration parameters
- Configuration validation during startup

## Deployment Patterns

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Containerized Deployment Pattern**
- Docker-based deployment with docker-compose
- Proper handling of container lifecycle
- Volume mapping for persistent data
- Environment variable injection

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Health Check Pattern**
- Regular system-wide health checks
- Component-specific health checks
- External monitoring integration (Prometheus)
- Alerting through Slack for critical issues

## Error Handling Patterns

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Graceful Degradation Pattern**
- System continues to function with partial component failure
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient errors
- Fallback strategies for critical components
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Monitoring Patterns

[2025-03-21 06:05:00] - **Real-time Monitoring Pattern**
- Continuous monitoring of system health
- Metrics collection and aggregation
- Threshold-based alerting

[2025-03-21 06:34:15] - **Memory Bank Activation Pattern**
- Automatic memory bank activation at session start
- Centralized script for loading all memory bank files
- Shell script wrapper for easy execution
- Custom mode configuration for memory bank functionality
- Status reporting with active/inactive indicators
- Historical metrics for trend analysis

[2025-03-21 17:15:30] - **Standardized API Client Pattern**
- Use of standardized client classes from api_clients.py
- Consistent Redis authentication across all connections
- Proper error handling for API client initialization
- Dependency injection for shared resources (Redis, etc.)

[2025-03-21 17:29:00] - **Configuration Standardization Pattern**
- Consistent port configuration across all system components
- Standardized environment variables in Docker and application code
- Single source of truth for configuration values
- Default values aligned with actual deployment settings
- Explicit authentication parameters across all connection points

[2025-03-22 02:45:00] - **GPU Acceleration Framework Pattern**
- Hierarchical GPU configuration in config.py with framework-specific settings
- Progressive GPU memory management based on usage thresholds
- Framework-specific cleanup procedures for TensorFlow, TensorRT, and CuPy
- Comprehensive GPU component verification during startup
- Graceful degradation when specific GPU frameworks are unavailable
- Automatic optimization selection based on available hardware
- Mixed precision training and inference for optimal performance
