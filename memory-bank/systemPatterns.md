[2025-03-23 18:32:30] - **Container Health Management Patterns**

Established the following patterns for container health management:

1. **Diagnostic-First Pattern**: Always diagnose container issues before attempting fixes. The `diagnose_container.sh` script provides comprehensive diagnostics to identify specific issues.

2. **Targeted Fix Pattern**: Apply specific fixes for known issues rather than rebuilding the entire container. The `fix_frontend_access.sh` script demonstrates this pattern by focusing only on frontend access issues.

3. **Comprehensive Fix Pattern**: When multiple issues are present, apply a comprehensive fix that addresses all issues in the correct order. The `fix_all_container_issues.sh` script implements this pattern.

4. **Service Isolation Pattern**: Configure each service with its own log files and error handling to simplify troubleshooting. The supervisord configuration demonstrates this pattern.

5. **Permission Remediation Pattern**: Ensure proper permissions for data directories and log files to prevent common container issues. This pattern is implemented in all fix scripts.

6. **Network Configuration Pattern**: Properly configure network settings including hosts file and port mappings to ensure services can communicate. This pattern is implemented in the fix scripts.

7. **Documentation-Driven Troubleshooting Pattern**: Provide comprehensive documentation on common issues and their fixes. The `CONTAINER_FIX_README.md` file implements this pattern.

[2025-03-22 20:25:10] - Production Management Patterns

Established the following patterns for production management:

1. **Unified Container Pattern**: Using a single Docker container with multiple services managed by supervisord. This pattern simplifies deployment and reduces inter-service communication overhead.

2. **Centralized Management Interface Pattern**: A master script (`manage_production.sh`) that provides a unified interface for all production operations. This pattern simplifies system administration and ensures consistent management practices.

3. **Verification-First Pattern**: Always verify production readiness before deployment using the `verify_production_readiness.sh` script. This pattern ensures that all required files and configurations are present and properly set up.

4. **Continuous Monitoring Pattern**: Regular health checks and monitoring using Prometheus and custom monitoring scripts. This pattern ensures early detection of issues and maintains system reliability.

5. **Automated Backup Pattern**: Regular automated backups with retention policies. This pattern ensures data safety and provides recovery options in case of failures.

6. **Environment Isolation Pattern**: Using Docker to isolate the production environment from the host system. This pattern ensures consistency across deployments and prevents dependency conflicts.

7. **GPU Optimization Pattern**: Specific optimizations for NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips. This pattern maximizes performance for GPU-accelerated components.
