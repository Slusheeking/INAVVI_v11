# Autonomous Trading System Improvements

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Service Consolidation
- Combined data_acquisition and data_processing into data_pipeline
- Combined model_training, model_services, and continuous_learning into model_platform
- Combined feature_engineering and trading_strategy into feature_trading
- Reduced inter-container communication points
- Simplified dependency chains

### 2. API Validation
- Added validation for Polygon, Unusual Whales, Alpaca, and Slack APIs
- Implemented feature flags to handle API unavailability gracefully
- Prevents system from starting with invalid API credentials

### 3. Environment Variable Validation
- Enhanced validation for all required environment variables
- Added checks for placeholder API keys to prevent production issues
- Implemented proper error reporting

### 4. Real API Keys
- Updated .env file with actual API keys for production use
- Secured API keys with proper validation

### 5. Simplified Directory Structure
- Created minimal directory structure for models, data, features, and results
- Removed unnecessary complexity
- Maintained only essential components

## Benefits

- **Fewer Containers**: 3 consolidated services instead of 7
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified architecture and directory structure
- **Improved Reliability**: Proper validation of external dependencies
- **Enhanced Security**: Real API keys with validation
- **Better Performance**: Reduced inter-container communication

## Usage
